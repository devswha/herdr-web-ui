/**
 * Who a request is and whether it gets in. There is no user database: a request is trusted
 * for where it comes from (this PC, with no proxy in front), for who Tailscale says it is
 * (the PC's own login, which `tailscale serve` states in a header it strips from what it
 * receives), or for what it holds (a paired device's cookie, or the shared token). A token,
 * when one is configured, is required of everything else, this PC included: a paired device
 * and the PC's own Tailscale login still get in without it, but a plain local connection does
 * not, since the remote-PC bridge runs on a loopback port of a PC other people may use.
 * Without a token, and until the first device is paired, anything that reaches the server is
 * let in as it always was, except through a proxy
 * on a PC whose Tailscale login is known: there, a request with no login header is a tagged
 * node (tailscale serve states no person for it), and a tailnet can hold many of those.
