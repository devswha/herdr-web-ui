 * and the work's notice will start the next turn by itself, with no prompt: the pane reads DONE
 * and alerts "work finished" while the work goes on. Live, herdr reads that next turn as
 * `working` about 2 s after the work ended.
 *
 * So a pane at rest whose turn's work runs, or ended less than WAIT_GRACE_MS ago, is waiting:
 * the sidebar says so in place of DONE, and the alerts take it for working (`alertStatus`,
 * shared/notify-policy.ts), so a turn that goes on is one turn, alerted once when it ends. Work
 * that ended before the turn did holds nothing. The limit starts at the first rest after the
 * person's prompt, not at each automatic resume. A resting baseline starts no hold.
